# Examples

This directory contains several small examples, which will hopefully show how to use some of Termloop's features.

## movingtext.go

This example demonstrates how to use keyboard input, as well as the Text builtin. To run, just do:

`go run movingtext.go "Some text here"`

## collision.go

This example demonstrates how to use Termloop's built in collision checking, as well as simple keyboard input. It also includes an example of an FpsText. The player's rectangle will turn blue and stop when it collides with something. To run, just do:

`go run collision.go`
