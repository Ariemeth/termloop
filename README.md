Termloop is a pure Go game engine for the terminal, built on top of the excellent [Termbox](https://github.com/nsf/termbox-go). It provides a simple render loop for building games in the terminal, as well as some extras like collision detection, render timers and builtin entity types.

It also wraps some of the consts and structs provided by Termbox - ideally a user should not need both libraries imported.

A proper tutorial will come soon - for now, check out the examples.

Please note that I don't yet consider Termloop to be 'done', so changes are very likely to be breaking.
